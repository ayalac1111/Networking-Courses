# Lab 02 ‚Äì IPv6 Addressing and Static Routing

> Based on Linda MacEwan's IPv6 Lab
> 
> üöß *This lab is currently under development and will be released soon.*
> 
## üß≠ Overview
This lab introduces you to IPv6 routing concepts, including Global Unicast Addresses (GUA), Link-Local Addresses (LLA), Unique Local Addresses (ULA), and static route configuration using both GUA and LLA as next hops. You'll work through a multi-router topology, configure hosts, and verify IPv6 connectivity from end to end.

###  üéØ Learning Objectives
By the end of this lab, you will be able to:
- Identify and configure LLA, GUA, and ULA IPv6 address types.
- Apply default and static routes using GUA and LLA next hops.
- Use Linux and Cisco tools to validate IPv6 configuration and reachability.

---

## üí° Why This Lab is Important

IPv6 is the **future of network addressing**, and the future is already here. The explosion of connected devices, cloud computing, and Internet of Things (IoT) has exhausted the IPv4 address space. IPv6 solves this with an address space so vast that it could assign an IP to every grain of sand on Earth. 

In this lab, you will be:
- Practice configuring LLA, GUA, and ULA on Cisco routers and Linux VMs.
- Implement default and static IPv6 routes using both GUA and LLA next hops.
- Use Linux commands to validate neighbour discovery, SLAAC, and route behaviour.
- Test full IPv6 connectivity between network segments.

Most importantly, this lab gives you hands-on experience with IPv6 **as it‚Äôs deployed in production environments today**, statically at the edge, dynamically inside, and incrementally rolled out alongside IPv4 in dual-stack topologies.

### üìò IPv6 Addressing Format

#### General IPv6 formatting:

| Block            | Role             | Use                                |
| ---------------- | ---------------- | ---------------------------------- |
| `2010:acad::/48` | Student Internal | All router, VLAN, and lab configs  |
| `fd00::/8`       | ULA Loopbacks    | Non-routable internal only         |
| `2001:db8::/32`  | Remote / Teacher | Simulated external/public services |
#### Student Addressing:
All students use the format `2010:acad:U:<segment>::/64`, where:
-  `U` is your assigned unique student number (e.g., `1`, `2`, ..., `30`)
- `<segment>` is a 2-letter hex code for the link:

| Student Segment       | Link Segment | Interface or Purpose |
| --------------------- | ------------ | -------------------- |
| `2010:acad:U:aa::/64` | **`aa`**     | SA VLAN 10 (PC LAN)  |
| `2010:acad:U:ab::/64` | **`ab`**     | SA ‚Üî RB link         |
| `2010:acad:U:bc::/64` | **`bc`**     | RB ‚Üî RC link         |
| `2010:acad:U:cc::/64` | **`cc`**     | RC VLAN 20 (VM LAN)  |

## Part A - Setting Up IPv6 Addresses

#### IPv6 Address Types Summary

In IPv6, a single interface can have **multiple IP addresses**, and this is **by design**. Unlike IPv4, where typically one IP is assigned per interface, IPv6 interfaces often have a **Link-Local Address (LLA)** and **one or more Global Unicast Addresses (GUAs)** at the same time. The **LLA** (starting with `fe80::/10`) is automatically generated and used for communication within the local link, such as neighbour discovery or routing protocol exchanges. Meanwhile, the **GUA** (starting with `2000::/3`) is routable across networks and used for regular data traffic. This **multi-address model** enhances flexibility, allowing interfaces to participate in local control-plane functions while also handling end-to-end global traffic.

| Address Type | Prefix / Format | Purpose                        | Where Used in Lab    | Notes                                                                  |
| ------------ | --------------- | ------------------------------ | -------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **LLA**      | `fe80::/10`     | Local link-only communication  | All interfaces.      | Required for neighbour discovery and used as next-hop in static routes |
| **GUA**      | `2000::/3`      | Global communication routing   | Physical interfaces. | Used for default/static routes, ping tests, and Internet access        |
| **ULA**      | `fd00::/8`      | Private internal communication | Loopback interfaces. | Similar to private IPv4 (RFC1918); not routable on global Internet     |
### 1. Addressing
- [ ] For **SA**:  
	- [ ] Create `VLAN 10` and `VLAN 666`, 
	- [ ] Use VLAN names as `username-VLAN10` and `username-VLAN666`.
	- [ ] Set Switchport `Gix0/0/2-10` in `VLAN 10`
	- [ ] All other switchports should be moved to `VLAN 666` and `shutdown`.
	- [ ] Assign an IPv6 address to SVI `VLAN 10` as in the network diagram.
	- [ ] Ensure the SVI is `UP/UP`.
- [ ] For all devices:
	- [ ] Assign LLA and GUA on all interfaces according to the topology.
	- [ ] Loopback interfaces use ULA addresses (`fdxx::/8`).
	- [ ] Create a description for each interface.
- [ ] Verify interfaces are **`up/up`**, and there are no address typos.
#### ‚öôÔ∏è Example Cisco IOS Configuration for `Gi1/0/1` on SA

> Assuming `U=100` and interface `Gi1/0/1`

```bash
interface GigabitEthernet1/0/1
 description Link to RB
 ipv6 address fe80::10 link-local           ! Manually set LLA
 ipv6 address 2010:acad:100:ab::10/64       ! GUA (student-specific, with U=100)
 no shutdown
```

#### ‚öôÔ∏è Example Cisco IOS ULA Configuration for `Lo10` on SA

```bash
interface loopback10
 description ULA loopback
 ipv6 address fe80::10 link-local            ! Manually set LLA
 ipv6 address fd00:100:aa::10/64             ! LUA Address for Loopback
```

#### üîç Verify your results (SA Sample)

Unlike the IPv4 version of this command, the IPv6 output is **not formatted as a table**. Instead, each interface name appears on its own line, and its IPv6 addresses (both **Link-Local** and **Global/ULA**) are listed **below** it.

```bash
ayalac-SA#show ipv6 int brief
GigabitEthernet1/0/1     [up/up]
    FE80::10
    2010:ACAD:100:AB::10
Loopback10             [up/up]
    FE80::10
    FD00:100:AA::10
Vlan10                 [up/up]
    FE80::10
    2010:ACAD:100:AA::10
```

‚úîÔ∏è **What to look for:**
- The interface status (`[up/up]`) is on the **same line** as the interface name.
- The **Link-Local Address** (`FE80::...`) is usually listed **first**.
- The **GUA or ULA** appears on the **next line**.

 ‚ö†Ô∏è **Common Mistakes to Watch For**:
- **Missing address**: Likely due to forgetting `no shutdown` or a misconfigured prefix.
- **Wrong `U` value**: Double-check that it matches your number assigned.
- **LLA mismatch**: If it shows something like `FE80::1AB:23FF:FECD:4567`, that means it‚Äôs still **auto-generated**, not manually assigned.
- **SVI down**:  Check that your VLAN is created and has switchports associated with it.
### üîç CO1 - Verification and Collection of Information

Copy the following commands in your `02-username.txt`file, under the label **CO1**:

From SA, RB and RC:

```

```

## Part B - Routing Configuration

### 1. SA:

- [ ] Configure a **fully specified default route using RB's GUA next hop**.
- [ ] A ping from SA to RB's GUA should be successful

Configure a **default route on SA** using the **Global Unicast Address (GUA)** of its next-hop neighbour (RB). 

**SA** is at the edge of the network, and it needs to send traffic to other routers or devices beyond its own link. Using the **GUA of RB** makes it clear and easy to route traffic across multiple segments. It‚Äôs also **more intuitive for beginners**, as the GUA is human-readable and globally scoped.
#### ‚öôÔ∏è Cisco default route using LLA as the next hop
``` bash
ipv6 route ::/0 gigabitethernet1/0/1  2010:acad:100:ab::11
```
> *Send all unknown traffic to the next-hop at `2010:acad:100:ab::11`, reachable via interface `G1/0/1`.*

### 2. RC:

- [ ] Configure a **default route using an LLA next hop**.
- [ ] A ping from RC to RB's GUA should be successful.

Configure a **default IPv6 route on RC**, but instead of using a GUA, you‚Äôll use the **Link-Local Address (LLA)** of the next-hop router (RB).

LLAs are **guaranteed to be present** and don‚Äôt change, even if GUAs are renumbered. That makes them ideal for **stable local links**, especially for static routing on simple point-to-point connections. When configuring routes using LLAs, the exit interface *must* be configured, since LLAs are **only unique on each link**, IOS needs to know **which interface** to send the packet out. Without it, the router wouldn't know which neighbour the LLA refers to.
#### ‚öôÔ∏è Cisco default route using LLA as the next hop
``` bash
ipv6 route ::/0 gigabitethernet0/0/2 fe80::2
```

This command means:

> *Send all unknown traffic to the next-hop at `fe80::2`, but only reachable via interface `G0/0/2`.*

### 3. RB:

- [ ] Configure **4 static routes** to SA and RC networks using the LLAs as next hops.
- [ ] Configure a **default route** to Remote networks using the GUA next hop.
- [ ] Pings to the TFTP/SCP servers should be successful.

On RB, you'll configure **specific static routes** for known internal networks, like SA and RC‚Äôs LAN and loopback interfaces, and then use a **single default route** to handle all traffic destined for the external or teacher network. This approach keeps the routing table clean and easy to troubleshoot. Instead of overloading RB with unnecessary routes, you define only what‚Äôs needed for internal reachability, and let the default route handle everything else.

> *Don‚Äôt over-configure. Use specific routes for known subnets and a default for ‚Äòeverything else.‚Äô Less clutter = cleaner troubleshooting.*

### üîç CO2 - Verification and Collection of Information

Copy the following commands in your `02-username.txt`file, under the label **CO2**:

```
- SA, RB, RC: show ipv6 route
- SA:  ping 2001:db8:192::62                 ! TFTP Server
- RC:  ping fd00:U:aa::10                    ! SA - Lo10
- RC:  ping fd00:U:aa::10 source Lo12        ! SA - Lo10 sourcing from Lo12
```

## Part D -  üñ•Ô∏è Host & VM Configuration

### 1. Windows PC:
- [ ] Use SLAAC to obtain an IPv6 address
- [ ] Verify at least 1 GUA and 1 LLA in the `2010:acad:U:aa::/64` network
- [ ] A ping to the TFTP server IPv6 address should be successful
- [ ] Test web browser access: `http://[2001:db8:192::69]`

### 2. Alpine VM:

#### üñ•Ô∏è Why You‚Äôre Using Alpine Linux in This Lab

In this lab, you work with a lightweight Linux VM called **Alpine** instead of another Windows system. In the real world, most network devices, servers, and cloud systems run on Linux, and often without a graphical interface. By using Alpine, you‚Äôll gain experience with essential **command-line tools** like `ip`, `ip -6 route`, and `ip neighbor`, which help you understand and verify IPv6 behaviour such as **SLAAC**, **EUI-64**, and routing. 

This is a valuable chance to build comfort with cross-platform networking, preparing you for careers in **DevOps, network engineering, and systems administration**, where Linux is everywhere.

- [ ] Use `ip link set up dev eth0`
- [ ] Verify SLAAC-derived IPv6 address matches EUI-64 from MAC
- [ ] Use `ip address show`, `ip -6 route show`, and `ip neighbor`

#### ‚öôÔ∏è Alpine Linux - Dynamic IP address

``` bash
ip link set up dev eth0
```

#### üîç Verify your results

```bash
VM-Alpine:~$ ip add show eth0
2: eth0: <BROADCAST,MULTICAST,UP,LOWER_UP> mtu 1500 qdisc pfifo_fast state UP qlen 1000
    link/ether 52:54:00:13:12:93 brd ff:ff:ff:ff:ff:ff
    inet6 2010:acad:100:cc:5054:ff:fe13:1293/64 scope global dynamic flags 100 
       valid_lft 2591921sec preferred_lft 604721sec
    inet6 fe80::5054:ff:fe13:1293/64 scope link 
       valid_lft forever preferred_lft forever
       
VM-Alpine:~$ ip -6 route show
2010:acad:100:cc::/64 dev eth0  metric 256  expires 0sec
fe80::/64 dev eth0  metric 256 
default via fe80::12 dev eth0  metric 1024  expires 0sec
multicast ff00::/8 dev eth0  metric 256 

VM-Alpine:~$ ip nei
fe80::12 dev eth0 lladdr 52:54:00:19:89:e5 router ref 1 used 0/0/0 probes 1 REACHABLE
```

Where:
- `link/ether` shows your MAC address.
-  `inet6`shows your IPv6 address.
	- First, your GUA, then your LLA
- Note that the last 6 hex numbers of your MAC address are used to form your IPv6 addresses
### üîç CO3 - Verification and Collection of Information

Copy the following commands in your `02-username.txt`file, under the label **CO3**:

```bash
ALPINE:
ip address show dev eth0
ip -6 route show
ip neighbor
ping -c 4 PC-Address                ! You will need to find this Address on PC 
ping -c 4 fd00:100:aa::10           ! SA-Lo10
ping -c 4 2001:db8:192::69
```
