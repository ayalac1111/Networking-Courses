# üß™ IPv6 Address Shortening Practice

Practice compressing full IPv6 addresses using the proper rules:
- Omit leading zeros in each group
- Replace the **longest** consecutive group of zero hextets (`0000`) with `::` (only once)
- When there are multiple zero blocks of the same length, always compress the **first one**

---

### ‚úèÔ∏è Instructions:
Shorten each IPv6 address to its compressed form.
