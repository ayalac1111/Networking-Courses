# üß™ IPv6 EUI-64 Address Generation Practice

Use this worksheet to practice generating full IPv6 addresses from MAC addresses using the **EUI-64** method.

## Instructions:
For each host:
1. Split the MAC address into two halves.
2. Insert `FFFE` in the middle.
3. Flip the 7th bit of the first byte.
4. Append the interface ID to the IPv6 prefix to form the full address.
