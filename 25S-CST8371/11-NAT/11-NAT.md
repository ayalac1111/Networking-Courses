# Lab 11: Public-to-Private Address Translation Techniques


## üß≠ Overview

In this lab, you will deepen your understanding of IPv4 Network Address Translation (NAT) by configuring a single border router to translate traffic between private internal networks and the public Internet. You‚Äôll work through three essential NAT scenarios:

1. **Port Address Translation (PAT)** on the router‚Äôs outside interface, allowing multiple inside hosts to share one public IP.
2. **Static port-forwarding**, mapping a specific TCP port on the public address to an internal server.
3. **Dynamic PAT using an address pool**, enabling inside hosts to translate to a small range of public IPs.

This hands-on exercise builds critical skills in conserving IPv4 address space and providing controlled inbound access‚Äîpractical expertise for any enterprise network engineer.

---

## üéØ Learning Objectives

By the end of this lab, you will be able to:

- **Prepare interfaces for NAT** by assigning `ip nat inside` and `ip nat outside` on the correct router ports.
- **Create standard access-lists** to identify traffic for translation.
- **Define and apply a PAT overload** on the router‚Äôs public interface so multiple hosts share one IP.
- **Configure static port-forwarding** to permit inbound TCP connections on a specified public port.
- **Set up dynamic PAT with a pool** of public addresses for inside hosts.
- **Verify and troubleshoot NAT** using `show ip nat translations`, `show access-lists`, and end-to-end connectivity tests.
- **Document your work** by capturing configurations and command outputs for submission.

## üí°Why This Lab Is Important

Network Address Translation (NAT) is a foundational technique in IPv4 networks, allowing organizations to:

- **Conserve scarce IPv4 addresses** by enabling multiple internal hosts to share a single public IP (PAT) or a small pool of addresses (dynamic PAT).
- **Control and secure inbound access** through static port-forwarding, exposing only necessary services to the Internet while keeping internal networks hidden.
- **Maintain address consistency** when renumbering or merging networks, since internal addressing can remain unchanged behind a NAT boundary.
    
By mastering PAT, static port-forwarding, and dynamic NAT pools, you‚Äôll gain practical skills that are essential for designing, operating, and troubleshooting real-world enterprise networks under IPv4 constraints.

![Lab 11 Topology](img/11-Topology.png)

## üìò  Addressing Table (IPv4)

Use the table below to configure your devices. Replace `<U>` with your assigned student ID number.

| Device             | Interface | IP Address (CIDR)  | Description                                 |
| ------------------ | --------- | ------------------ | ------------------------------------------- |
| **RA**             | Gi0/0/0   | `203.0.113.U/24`   | Outside interface to Internet               |
| **RA**             | Gi0/0/1   | `198.18.U.17/29`   | Inside interface, OSPF neighbor to RB       |
| **RB**             | Gi0/0/0   | `10.U.18.1/28`     | Inside gateway for dynamic NAT pool hosts   |
| **RB**             | Gi0/0/1   | `198.18.U.22/29`   | OSPF neighbour to RA                        |
| **RB**             | Gi0/0/2   | `172.16.9.33/28`   | Host receiving static port‚Äêforward (Telnet) |
| **RB**             | LoU       | `192.168.U.1/24`   | Private network                             |
| **VM (PAT host)**  | Gi0/0/2   | `172.16.9.46/28`   | Inside host for PAT translation tests       |
| **PC (Pool host)** | Gi0/0/0   | `10.U.18.14/28`    | Inside host for dynamic NAT pool tests      |
| **Remote**         | ‚Äî         | `203.0.113.254/24` | External tester for Internet connectivity   |

> **VM Network Note**:
> **All students will use the same VM network (172.17.9.32/28) and configure identical IP addresses on their VMs.**  
> This demonstrates how overlapping private networks can coexist behind NAT: although every student‚Äôs VM will have the same internal address, the NAT on their border router will translate traffic uniquely to the public Internet.

## Partner Collaboration

You will need a partner for connectivity testing. If you don‚Äôt find a partner, ask your lab instructor to telnet into your switch.

- [ ]  You will each configure your own devices but work together to test connectivity. The topology diagram shows **only your own** devices; your partner will have the same topology on their end.
- [ ]  You need **one PC** and **one VM** each for testing.
- [ ] If you finish early, help your partner, but do **not** touch their keyboard.
- [ ] If your partner runs into a problem, guide them through troubleshooting. You **both** need full end-to-end connectivity for full marks.

---

## üõ†Ô∏è Initial Setup

### 0. Create submission file
- [ ]  On your desktop, create **three** files:
	- [ ] `11-OSPF-username.txt`
	- [ ] `11-NAT-username.txt`
	- [ ] `11-ACL-username.txt`
- [ ] You will later copy these files to the REMOTE TFTP server as proof of completion.
### 1. Basic Configuration
- [ ] Use the provided base configuration file: [basic.cfg](../Resources/basic.cfg)
- [ ] Enable real-time debug output display on all routers.
### 2. Addressing Configuration
- [ ] Configure addresses according to the topology diagram, paying attention to the network masks.
- [ ] Add a description to all Cisco interfaces.
- [ ] Ensure all interfaces are UP/UP before continuing.

---

## OSPF Configuration

- [ ] **Process ID**: Use `U` as the OSPF process number.
- [ ] **Router-IDs**: Manually set each router‚Äôs ID under OSPF:
	- [ ] `RA`:  `U.0.0.17`
	- [ ] `RB`: `U.0.0.22`
- [ ] **Default Gateway Advertisement**: On **EDGE**, redistribute or originate a default route so that `0.0.0.0/0` is known across the OSPF domain
- [ ] **CORE‚ÄìEDGE DR Election**: **EDGE** should _not_ participate in the DR election.
- [ ] Configure explicitly all interfaces **not directly connected to an OSPF neighbour** as passive.
	- [ ] [-1 Point] deduction if using the `network` command.
- [ ] Set the OSPF **reference bandwidth** to `10000 Mbps`.
- [ ] Ensure all loopback interfaces report the **configured mask**, not a default host mask.
- [ ] On the `198.18.U.16/29` network, configure OSPF for **fast convergence** by setting:
	  - [ ] `Hello` interval: 3 seconds
	  - [ ] `Dead` interval: 5 seconds

## <span style="color: red; font-weight: bold;">NEW</span> Services Configuration

### PC Service Configuration

On your PC (using TFTP64):

1. Launch **TFTP64** and open the **Settings** menu.
2. Enable the **TFTP** service and the **Syslog** service.
3. Set the **Base Directory** (or ‚ÄúHome Directory‚Äù) to your **Desktop** so that any transferred files and log files are easy to locate.

### Routers Configuration

On **both** RA and RB, enter global configuration mode and apply the following:

```bash
! 1. Synchronize time via NTP
ntp server 203.0.113.254

! 2. Send syslog messages to your PC‚Äôs Syslog server
logging trap informational
! (Optionally adjust trap level: debug, informational, warnings, errors, etc.)

! Specify which source interface‚Äôs IP shows up on the syslog messages
logging source-interface GigabitEthernet0/0/0

! Point syslog to the PC
logging host 10.U.18.14 transport udp port 514

! (Optional) Include timestamps in the log messages
service timestamps log datetime msec localtime
```

- **`ntp server 203.0.113.254`** ensures your router clocks are synchronized with the remote time source.
- **`logging trap informational`** sets the minimum severity level of messages sent to your
- **`logging source-interface`** picks the outbound interface whose IP is used as the syslog source address.
- **`logging host ‚Ä¶ transport udp port 514`** directs syslog packets to your PC on the standard syslog port.
- **`service timestamps`** adds human‚Äêreadable timestamps to each log entry.

On **RA**, enable the built-in HTTP and HTTPS web interface for management:

```bash
! Enable the HTTP server (clear-text)
ip http server
ip http authentication local

! Enable the HTTPS (secure) server
ip http secure-server
```

- `ip http server` turns on the HTTP daemon.
- `ip http secure-server` turns on the HTTPS daemon (uses TLS).
- `ip http authentication local` tells the router to check the local username database for web logins.


### üîç CO2 ‚Äì Verification and Collection of Information

üìù In your `11-OSPF-<username>.txt` file, create four sections labelled:

```diff
=== CO2 ‚Äì Services Verification ===
```

**Testing Preparation:**
1. **Console into RA** (your workstation) and  `ssh` into RB.
2. From your PC browser, open an HTTPS session to RA and log in with your credentials.

Copy the output of the commands listed below for **RA**:

```bash
show ssh
show ip ssh
show ip http server status
show ip http secure-server status
show users

## NAT Rule #1: Translate to the Public Address of the Exit Interface

**Hosts in the VM Network 172.16.9.32/28 must share RA‚Äôs public IP when accessing the Internet.**

1. **Identify the NAT device**
    - Device: **RA** (the border router with the public‚Äêfacing interface)
2. **Set inside/outside interfaces**
    ```bash
    ! On RA
	interface GigabitEthernet0/0/1
	  ip nat inside
	interface GigabitEthernet0/0/0
	  ip nat outside
    ```
    
3. **Create a standard ACL (16) to match the inside network**
	```bash
	access-list 16 permit 172.16.9.32 0.0.0.15
	```
    
4. **Enable PAT to the exit interface‚Äôs public IP**
    ```bash
    ip nat inside source list 16 interface GigabitEthernet0/0/0 overload
    ```

	Command explanation:
	- **`ip nat inside source`**  
	    Specifies that we‚Äôre translating source addresses of packets coming from the **inside** network.
	- **`list 16`**  
	    Uses the **standard ACL 16** to identify which source addresses to translate (in our case, every host in `172.16.9.32/28`).
	- **`interface GigabitEthernet0/0/0`**  
	    Tells the router to use the IP address assigned to **Gi0/0/0** (the outside/public interface) as the translated address.
	- **`overload`**  
	    Enables **Port Address Translation (PAT)**, which lets **all** matched inside hosts share that single public IP by mapping their source port numbers.
	    Put simply, this one line says:

> For any packet sourced from `172.16.9.32/28`, translate its private source IP to the public IP on Gi0/0/0; and because of `overload`, allow many private hosts to reuse that one public IP by differentiating them via port numbers.

### Testing NAT with DNS and ICMP

Now we‚Äôll generate two types of traffic from the **VM** verify their entries in the NAT table on **RA**. Note that `www.cnap.cst` resolves to **192.0.2.80**.

1. **Set VM's DNS server** to 192.0.2.53 in your network settings.
2. **Enable NAT debugging** on RA
	```bash
	RA# debug ip nat
	```
3. From VM: **Perform a DNS lookup**
	```bash
	VM# nslookup www.cnap.cst
	Server:         192.0.2.53
	Address:        192.0.2.53#53

	Non-authoritative answer:
	Name:   www.cnap.cst
	Address: 192.0.2.80
	```
4. From VM: **Perform a ping to www.cnap.cst**
5. **Inspect the NAT translation table**
	```bash
	RA# show ip nat translations
	```
	
!-- Sample Output
	<table border="1" cellpadding="4" cellspacing="0">
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>Pro</th>
      <th>Inside Global</th>
      <th>Inside Local</th>
      <th>Outside Local</th>
      <th>Outside Global</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>UDP</td>
      <td>203.0.113.17:52345</td>
      <td>172.16.9.46:52345</td>
      <td>192.0.2.53:53</td>
      <td>192.0.2.53:53</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>ICMP</td>
      <td>203.0.113.17:1</td>
      <td>172.16.9.46:1</td>
      <td>192.0.2.80:0</td>
      <td>192.0.2.80:0</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

6. **Verify ACL and statistics**
```bash
RA# show access-lists 16
RA# show ip nat statistics
```
- **ACL 16** should report ‚â• 2 hits.
- **Total active translations** should be ‚â• 2.

7. **Disable debugging**
Before you disable debugging, you should see console messages for each translation event. Here‚Äôs an example of what two packets look like in the debug output (timestamps illustrative):

```bash
`*Mar 19 14:05:01.123: NAT: s=172.16.9.46(52345) d=192.0.2.53(53) proto=UDP translate src to 203.0.113.17(52345) 
*Mar 19 14:05:02.456: NAT: s=172.16.9.46(icmptype:8 icmpid:0) d=192.0.2.80(icmptype:8 icmpid:0) proto=ICMP translate src to 203.0.113.17(1)
```

- The **first line** shows the VM‚Äôs DNS query (UDP/53) being translated: source 172.16.9.46:52345 becomes 203.0.113.17:52345.
- The **second line** shows the ICMP echo (ping): ICMP type 8/id 0 from 172.16.9.46 is translated to ICMP type 8/id 1 on 203.0.113.17.

Once you‚Äôve observed these messages, you can turn off debugging:

```bash
RA# undebug all
```

## NAT Rule #2: Static Port‚ÄêForwarding

**‚ÄúAllow Internet users to Telnet to our internal switch at 172.16.9.33:23 via RA‚Äôs public IP on TCP 2323.‚Äù**

- [ ] Code a **port-forwarding** rule so that external hosts can connect to the telnet server on the switch. 
    ```
    ip nat inside source static <tcp/udp> <in_addr port> <out_add port>
    ```
    - [ ] Telnet is a TCP protocol
    - [ ] Outside hosts should connect to `203.0.113.U` port `2323`.
    - [ ] Internally, the switch telnet server is at `172.16.9.33` port `23`.

**Testing:**
- [ ] From PC, telnet to your partner's router `203.0.113.P` and login.  Keep the connection open, 
- [ ] From PC, telnet to your partner's switch `203.0.113.P 2323` and login.  Keep the connection open. 
- [ ] From your partner PC, telnet to your router `203.0.113.U` and login.  Keep the connection open
- [ ] From your partner PC, telnet to your switch ``203.0.113.U 2323` and login.  Keep the connection open.

> `P`:  Your partner's `U`
> You are testing your partner's configuration.  They are testing your configuration.
