# Lab 05 ‚Äì Tuning OSPF and Advanced Configuration

## üß≠ Overview

In this lab, you'll **tune and refine OSPF behaviour** beyond basic adjacency and route sharing. You‚Äôll work with **router IDs**, **OSPF interface types**, **Designated Router elections**, **timer tuning**, and **passive interfaces**. 

This lab **builds directly on your configuration from Lab 04**, using the same topology and IP addresses, and focuses on making OSPF more predictable and scalable.

---
## üéØ Learning Objectives

By the end of this lab, you will be able to:

- Configure and verify manual **router IDs**
- Adjust **OSPF network types** for loopbacks
- Influence **DR/BDR elections** using priority and router ID
- Tune **Hello and Dead** intervals and adjacency changes
- Use **passive interfaces** to reduce OSPF overhead on end-user networks

---
## üí° Why This Lab is Important

Basic OSPF configuration is enough to get routes flowing, but **network engineers must fine-tune OSPF** to meet the performance, stability, and security needs of real-world environments.

This lab helps you build those skills, by adjusting how OSPF selects router IDs, advertises loopbacks, forms adjacencies, and reacts to interface behaviour. Mastering these features will make your OSPF deployments more **predictable**, **scalable**, and **secure**.

## üõ†Ô∏è Initial Setup

Before starting, complete the following steps to ensure your lab environment is ready:

- [ ] Create a submission file named: `05-username.txt`  
  ‚Üí This is where you will paste all required command outputs (CO1‚ÄìCO5) for grading. Replace `username` with your Algonquin login.
  
- [ ] Load your saved **running-configs from Lab 04**
  ‚Üí If you didn‚Äôt save your configs, you may need to reconfigure routers manually based on Lab 04 instructions.

- [ ] <span style="color: red; font-weight: bold;">NEW</span> Set the **clock on each router** to ensure consistent times tamping in logs and debug messages.

	```bash
	clock set HH:MM:SS DAY MONTH YEAR
	!--- Example:
	clock set 15:00:00 26 May 2025
	```

- [ ] Verify that all interfaces are **up/up** and OSPF adjacencies are fully formed.
  ‚Üí Use `show ip ospf neighbor` on each router to confirm.

- [ ] Confirm **full IP reachability** across the topology
  ‚Üí You should be able to ping from each router to any other device in the network.

- [ ] If using SSH or Telnet, enable real-time debug output display:
	```bash
  terminal monitor
	```

üìå **IMPORTANT:** Do not continue until you‚Äôve confirmed the network is stable and all routers are forming adjacencies as expected.

---
## üîß Part A ‚Äì Configure OSPF Router ID

Each OSPF router must have a unique **Router ID** (RID), which is used in:
- Link State Advertisements (LSAs)
- Neighbour relationships
- SPF path calculations

If left to auto-select, the router may pick an unexpected interface IP, which could lead to unstable or inconsistent behaviour. Setting the RID manually is **best practice** in production networks.

> üîÅ **Router ID Selection Order in OSPF:**
> 1. Manually configured using `router-id`
> 2. Highest IP address on any loopback interface
> 3. Highest IP address on any active physical interface

### 1. Set the Static Router ID
Configure the following Router IDs under the OSPF process:

```bash
SA: router-id U.0.0.10
R1: router-id U.0.0.1
R2: router-id U.0.0.2
```

Use global configuration mode, e.g.:

```bash
router ospf U
 router-id U.0.0.10
```

### 2. Clear the OSPF Process (Mandatory)
In order for the new Router ID to take effect, you **must reset the OSPF process**:

```bash
clear ip ospf process
```

This will:

- Force re-evaluation of the Router ID
- Tear down and re-establish neighbour adjacencies
- Trigger SPF recalculations and LSA resync

This step is **necessary when changes** are made to parameters like the router ID or Hello/Dead intervals, which are only evaluated when the OSPF process starts.

> ‚ö†Ô∏è **Warning**: This causes a temporary disruption in routing while adjacencies reform. Always plan carefully when doing this on live networks.

### 3. Confirm Router IDs
After clearing the OSPF process, check the Router ID on each device:

```bash
show ip ospf
```
**‚úÖ What to check:**
- [ ] All routers display the manually configured Router ID
- [ ] Router IDs match those listed above

### üîç  CO1 ‚Äì Verification and Collection of Information

üìò **Sample Output Block**: ( partial show command)

 Routing Process "ospf 100" with ID 100.0.0.2
ayalac-SA#show ip ospf
 Routing Process "ospf 100" with ID 100.0.0.10
```

---
## üîß Part B ‚Äì OSPF Network Types (Loopbacks)

By default, OSPF advertises **loopback interfaces** as `/32` host routes, even when they‚Äôre configured with a larger subnet (like `/24`). This is intentional: loopbacks are logical interfaces, always ‚Äúup,‚Äù and are usually treated as **identifiers**, not full subnets.

However, if a loopback is meant to represent a **reachable network**, and you want routers to learn the **entire subnet** (e.g., `10.U.200.0/24`), you must change the OSPF **network type** for that interface.

### üîÅ Why This Matters

This is a common design decision in real networks:
- `/32` is great for router ID or loopback reachability
- `/24` is essential when simulating real LANs or requiring full subnet advertisement

### 1Ô∏è. Check How R2‚Äôs Loopback Is Advertised

1. Enable OSPF on `R2-Lo200` in area `0`.

2. From **R1**, check what R2 is currently advertising:

```bash
show ip route ospf
```

>‚ùì **Think About It**
Look for the route to: `10.U.200.2`.  Based on the current configuration, what prefix length do you expect to see for the `R2-Loopback200` on R1?
>
 üìù Write down your prediction in your notes before running the command.

### 2. Change the Network Type on R2
Modify the loopback configuration on **R2**:

```bash
interface loopback200
ip ospf network point-to-point
```
This tells OSPF to treat the loopback like a point-to-point interface, causing it to advertise the **real subnet mask** (e.g., `/24`).

> ‚ö†Ô∏è This only affects OSPF‚Äôs advertisement of the loopback ‚Äî it does not change the actual interface mask.

### 3. Re-verify from R1
Check R1‚Äôs routing table again.  Confirm that the full `/24` subnet is now being advertised and received.

## üîß Part C ‚Äì Designated Router (DR) Control

### Designated Router (DR) Elections in OSPF

In multi-access networks (like Ethernet), OSPF reduces LSA traffic by electing a **Designated Router (DR)**. Rather than each router exchanging LSAs with every other router, they send updates to the DR and Backup DR (BDR), simplifying communication.

### ü§ñ How DR is Elected

DR election depends on:

1. **OSPF Priority** (default: 1; priority 0 = ineligible)
2. **Router ID (RID)** ‚Äì used as a tiebreaker

Once elected, the DR remains in place until the adjacency resets ‚Äî **OSPF does not preempt**.

### 1. Predict the DR on Network 10.U.101.0/28

> ‚ùì **Think About It**  
> Based on the OSPF priorities and Router IDs from Part A, which router do you expect to be the **DR** on the `10.U.101.0/28` network?

‚Üí Make a prediction before running the command below.

Then, verify using:

```bash
show ip ospf neighbor
```

‚úÖ Check for the neighbour marked as **DR** on the interface connected to SA.

> üí¨ **Why might your prediction be wrong?**  
> DR elections are **non-preemptive** ‚Äî even if SA has a higher priority now, the current DR won‚Äôt change until the adjacency resets.

### 2. Raise R1‚Äôs Priority to Force DR Role
To influence the next DR election, increase R1‚Äôs OSPF priority on the interface facing SA:

```bash
interface gi0/0/0
ip ospf priority U
```

Verify if the DR election changed.

>‚ö†Ô∏è This change won't take effect unless the adjacency resets. DR elections are **non-preemptive** ‚Äî a new election only occurs when the OSPF neighbour state resets.

### 3. Trigger a New DR Election

1. On **R1**, enable OSPF debug:
```bash
debug ip ospf adj
```

2. On **SA**, shut and re-enable interface `Gi0/0/1` (the link to R1) to force a new election.  Shutdown the interface, wait for 10 seconds and then bring the interface up again.

3. Back on **R1**, stop debugging:
```bash
no debug all
!-- or
u all
```

üñ•Ô∏è **Sample output**, `U=100`.   
Your output should show the timestamp.  Note that this router's output may look a bit different than yours.
```bash
!-- Debug captures showing the election of the DR.
ayalac-R1# show logging | include OSPF

[4]  OSPF: DR/BDR election on interface GigabitEthernet0/0/0

[6]  OSPF: Neighbor 10.U.0.10 (GigabitEthernet0/0/0) state changed from INIT to 2WAY
[7]  OSPF: Neighbor 10.U.0.10 (GigabitEthernet0/0/0) state changed from 2WAY to EXSTART
[8]  OSPF: Neighbor 10.U.0.10 (GigabitEthernet0/0/0) state changed from EXSTART to EXCHANGE
[9]  OSPF: Neighbor 10.U.0.10 (GigabitEthernet0/0/0) state changed from EXCHANGE to FULL

## üîß Part D ‚Äì OSPF Hello and Dead Interval Mismatch

Neighbour relationships in OSPF are established and maintained through **Hello packets**, which are exchanged regularly on each interface. These packets are essential for detecting neighbours and maintaining adjacency.

Each `Hello` packet includes key information that must match between routers for a neighbour relationship to form, including:

- **Hello Interval** ‚Äì How often Hello packets are sent (default: 10 seconds on broadcast networks)
- **Dead Interval** ‚Äì How long to wait without hearing a Hello before declaring the neighbour down (default: 40 seconds)

> ‚è±Ô∏è These timers must match **exactly** on both ends of a link.  
> If there is a mismatch, the routers will see each other‚Äôs Hello packets but will **not form an adjacency**.

### üîÅ Why This Matters

Mismatched timers are a **top cause of adjacency failure** in real networks. This section helps you recognize the symptoms, diagnose them via debugging, and correct the mismatch.

### 1Ô∏è. Observe Current OSPF Timers

Start by checking the current Hello and Dead timers on R1 and R2:

```bash
show ip ospf interface gi0/0/1
```

### 2Ô∏è. Break the Adjacency Using a Timer Mismatch

On **R2**, change the Hello/Dead timers:

```bash
interface gi0/0/1
ip ospf hello-interval 5  
ip ospf dead-interval 20
```

Then, enable debug to capture messages:

```bash
debug ip ospf hello
```

If the adjacency doesn't reset, you may need to:

```bash
clear ip ospf process
```

üîç You should see messages like:

```

>üîç **Debug Line Guide**
>- **[2]** shows the mismatch detection
>- **[3]** confirms which timer values were expected (R) vs current (C)

### 3. Restore Adjacency by Matching Timers

1. Set the same timer values in R1's interface facing R2.
2. Observe the adjacency reforming and confirm via:
	```bash
	show ip ospf neighbor
	```

3. Stop debugging in **R2**.

	```bash
	no debug all
	```

> ‚ö†Ô∏è **Reminder**: Always stop debugging after capturing output ‚Äî it consumes CPU and clutters logs.

4. Verify the timer settings from R1:

	```bash
	show ip ospf interface gi0/0/1
	```

## üîß Part E ‚Äì Passive Interface

By default, OSPF sends **Hello packets** on every OSPF-enabled interface to discover and maintain neighbour relationships. However, not all interfaces need to form adjacencies.

For example, if an interface connects to a **user-facing network** (like a LAN with only PCs), there's no reason for OSPF to send Hellos ‚Äî the router just needs to **advertise the connected network**.

This is where **passive interfaces** come in.

When an interface is marked as **passive**, OSPF will:
- ‚úÖ Advertise the connected network into OSPF
- ‚ùå Suppress Hello packets, so **no neighbour relationship is attempted**

### üîÅ Why This Matters

Passive interfaces are used to:
- üîí **Improve security** ‚Äî prevent rogue neighbours from forming on access ports
- üìâ **Reduce unnecessary traffic** ‚Äî avoid sending Hello packets where they aren‚Äôt needed
- üßπ **Keep neighbour tables clean** ‚Äî particularly in large networks

This is a best practice in OSPF design for **edge interfaces or terminal networks**.

### 1. Identify the Interface to Make Passive

In this topology, the following interfaces should be made passive:

| Router | Interface   | Reason                          |
| ------ | ----------- | ------------------------------- |
| R1     | Gi0/0/2     | Connected to end-user LAN       |
| R2     | Loopback200 | Logical interface, no neighbors |

> ‚ùì **Think About It**  
> What would happen if you accidentally made **Gi0/0/0** passive on R1?

‚Üí Write your prediction before continuing.

### 2. Configure Passive Interfaces

On each router, enter OSPF configuration mode and apply the `passive-interface` command:
#### On R1:
```bash
router ospf U
 passive-interface gi0/0/2
```

#### On R2
Configure Loopback200 as a passive interface.

>‚ö†Ô∏è **Never mark router-to-router links as passive.** 
>Doing so disables neighbour formation and breaks routing.

### 3. Verify Passive Interface Behaviour

Use the following command to verify that each interface is now passive and that **Hello packets are no longer sent**:

```
show ip ospf interface [interface-name]
```

‚úÖ Look for:
- [ ] "The interface is passive"
- [ ] "Hello timer 0"
- [ ] No mention of DR/BDR state

### 4. Confirm the Route is Still Advertised

To prove that the passive interfaces still **advertise their networks**, run the following **cross-verification commands**:

1.  From **R1**, check for R2's loopback route:

	```bash
	show ip route 10.U.200.0 255.255.255.0
	```

2. From **R2**, check for R1's LAN route:

	```bash
	show ip route 10.U.1.0 255.255.255.0
	```

‚úÖ Output should show an `O` (OSPF) route, even though those interfaces are passive.

### üîç  CO5 ‚Äì Verification and Collection of Information

## üîß Part F ‚Äì Reference Bandwidth Tuning (Best Practice)

OSPF calculates interface cost using the formula:

```c++
Cost = Reference Bandwidth / Interface Bandwidth
```

>üßÆ OSPF uses **integer division**, not floating-point math.  
That means any **fractional results are rounded down**.

By default, the reference bandwidth is **100 Mbps**. This means:
- 100 Mbps = 100 Mbps / 1000 Mbps ‚Üí cost = 1
- 1 Gbps = 1000 Mbps / 1000 Mbps ‚Üí cost = 1
- 10 Gbps = 1000 Mbps / 1000 Mbps ‚Üí cost = 1

> üß† **Problem:** Modern networks have speeds of 1G, 10G, or even 100G ‚Äî but OSPF treats them all the same under the default reference, because they‚Äôre all **faster than 100 Mbps**, resulting in identical costs.

To solve this, we **raise the reference bandwidth**, typically to **10,000 Mbps (10 Gbps)** or higher, so that OSPF can distinguish between different high-speed links.
### üîÅ Why This Matters

Even though all interfaces in this lab are **1 Gbps**, in real enterprise environments with mixed-speed links (1G, 10G, 40G), setting the correct reference bandwidth ensures:

- üîÑ **Accurate cost calculation**
- üì∂ **Better path selection**
- üß∞ **More control** when tuning or optimizing OSPF behaviour

> üõ†Ô∏è This step is a best practice. It has **no visible impact in this lab**, but it prepares you for real-world OSPF scaling.

### 1Ô∏è. Apply Reference Bandwidth Change

Update the reference bandwidth to **10 Gbps** (10,000 Mbps) on **each router**.

```bash
router ospf U
 auto-cost reference-bandwidth 10000
```

>üí° You must apply this command to all OSPF routers in the network.
If not, they may calculate different costs and introduce routing inconsistencies.

### 2. Verify New Costs
After the change, verify the reference bandwidth in all routers:
```
show ip ospf | include Reference
```
‚úÖ Verify
- [ ] `Reference bandwidth unit is 10000 mbps`

### üîç CO6 ‚Äì Reference Bandwidth Verification
üìù In your 05-username.txt file, create a section labelled:

```

| üìú Full Output              | Submit the line that includes the reference bandwidth (e.g., `Reference bandwidth unit is 10000 mbps.`) |
| ‚öôÔ∏è Consistency Check        | Confirm that the **reference bandwidth is updated** across all routers                                  |
| üóíÔ∏è Comment                 | Add a short explanation per device, e.g.:                                                               |
|                             | `!-- Reference bandwidth updated to 10000 Mbps in all routers.`                                         |

>üí° **Wrap-up Thought:**
Setting the reference bandwidth is about future-proofing your OSPF design. Even though it has no visible effect now, it's a habit used in nearly every enterprise deployment.
