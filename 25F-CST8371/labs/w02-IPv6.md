# Lab 02 ‚Äì IPv6 Addressing and Static Routing

> Based on Linda MacEwan's IPv6 Lab

## Overview
You‚Äôll configure **LLA, GUA, and ULA** addresses on Cisco routers, build reachability with static routes using both GUA and LLA next hops, and practice IPv6 verification on Alpine Linux.  
You will bring up the **EDGE‚ÄìCORE topology**, confirm basic end-to-end reachability, and collect minimal evidence.

**You will:**
- Configure IPv6 addresses on all devices (LLA, GUA, ULA).
- Install static routes:
    - CORE ‚Üí default via EDGE (LLA).
    - EDGE ‚Üí default to REMOTE (GUA).
    - EDGE ‚Üí static to internal networks (LLA).
- Verify host behaviour: SLAAC on VM (Alpine), static vs SLAAC comparison.
- Capture concise **evidence lines** for grading.

**Estimated time:** 2h 45m (including verification + evidence capture).

---
### Learning Objectives

By the end of this lab, you should be able to:
1. Configure **manual LLA + GUA** on routers, and verify with `show ipv6 int brief`.
2. Use **ULA loopbacks** for internal testing.
3. Install and test **static routes** with both GUA and LLA next hops.
4. Verify host IPv6 addressing, routes, and neighbour discovery on **Alpine Linux**.
5. Capture **minimal evidence** for IPv6 connectivity and routing table correctness.

## üí° Why This Lab is Important

IPv6 is the **future of network addressing**, and the future is already here. The explosion of connected devices, cloud computing, and Internet of Things (IoT) has exhausted the IPv4 address space. IPv6 solves this with an address space so vast that it could assign an IP to every grain of sand on Earth. 

In this lab, you will be:
- Practice configuring LLA, GUA, and ULA on Cisco routers and Linux VMs.
- Implement default and static IPv6 routes using both GUA and LLA next hops.
- Use Linux commands to validate neighbour discovery, SLAAC, and route behaviour.
- Test full IPv6 connectivity between network segments.

Most importantly, this lab gives you hands-on experience with IPv6 **as it‚Äôs deployed in production environments today**, statically at the edge, dynamically inside, and incrementally rolled out alongside IPv4 in dual-stack topologies.

### üìò IPv6 Addressing Format

#### General IPv6 formatting:

| Block               | Role                  | Use                                        |
| ------------------- | --------------------- | ------------------------------------------ |
| `2010:acad::/48`    | Student Internal      | All router, VLAN, and lab configs          |
| `fd00:U::/8`        | Loopbacks             | Non-routable internal only                 |
| `2001:fab:203::/64` | Transit to Server LAN | Transit network towards the Server network |
| `2001:db8:192::/64` | Server LAN            | Public servers, including the TFTP server  |
#### Student Addressing:
All students use the format `2010:acad:U:<segment>::/64`, where:
-  `U` is your assigned unique student number (e.g., `1`, `2`, ..., `30`)
- `<segment>` is a 2-letter hex code for the link:

| Student Segment       | Link Segment | Interface or Purpose |
| --------------------- | ------------ | -------------------- |
| `2010:acad:U:aa::/64` | **`aa`**     | PC LAN               |
| `2010:acad:U:bc::/64` | **`bc`**     | EDGE ‚Üî CORE link     |
| `2010:acad:U:cc::/64` | **`cc`**     | VM LAN               |

### Task 1 - Setting Up the Routers' IPv6 Addresses 

#### IPv6 Address Types Summary

In IPv6, a single interface can have **multiple IP addresses**, and this is **by design**. Unlike IPv4, where typically one IP is assigned per interface, IPv6 interfaces often have a **Link-Local Address (LLA)** and **one or more Global Unicast Addresses (GUAs)** at the same time. The **LLA** (starting with `fe80::/10`) is automatically generated and used for communication within the local link, such as neighbour discovery or routing protocol exchanges. Meanwhile, the **GUA** (starting with `2000::/3`) is routable across networks and used for regular data traffic. This **multi-address model** enhances flexibility, allowing interfaces to participate in local control-plane functions while also handling end-to-end global traffic.

| Address Type | Prefix / Format | Purpose                        | Where Used in Lab    | Notes                                                                  |
| ------------ | --------------- | ------------------------------ | -------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **LLA**      | `fe80::/10`     | Local link-only communication  | All interfaces.      | Required for neighbour discovery and used as next-hop in static routes |
| **GUA**      | `2000::/3`      | Global communication routing   | Physical interfaces. | Used for default/static routes, ping tests, and Internet access        |
| **ULA**      | `fd00::/8`      | Private internal communication | Loopback interfaces. | Similar to private IPv4 (RFC1918); not routable on global Internet     |
#### 1. Routers Addressing
- [ ] Enable IPv6 routing using `ipv6 unicast-routing`
- [ ] Assign LLA and GUA on all interfaces according to the topology.
- [ ] Loopback interfaces use ULA addresses (`fdxx::/8`).
- [ ] Create a description for each interface.
- [ ] Verify interfaces are **`up/up`**, and there are no address typos.
#### ‚öôÔ∏è Example Cisco IOS Configuration - `EDGE-Gi0/0/0`

> Assuming `U=250` 

```bash
interface GigabitEthernet0/0/0
 description Link to REMOTE
 ipv6 address fe80::250 link-local           ! Manually set LLA
 ipv6 address 2001:fab:203::250/64           ! GUA (student-specific, with U=250)
 no shutdown
```

#### ‚öôÔ∏è Example Cisco IOS ULA Configuration - `CORE-Lo12` 

```bash
interface loopback12
 description ULA loopback
 ipv6 address fe80::12 link-local            ! Manually set LLA
 ipv6 address fd00:250:cc::12/64             ! LUA Address for Loopback
```

#### 2. Verify your results

Unlike the IPv4 version of this command, the IPv6 output is **not formatted as a table**. Instead, each interface name appears on its own line, and its IPv6 addresses (both **Link-Local** and **Global/ULA**) are listed **below** it.

```bash
ayalac-CORE#show ipv6 int brief | exclude unassigned|down
GigabitEthernet0/0/2     [up/up]
    FE80::12
    2010:ACAD:250:BC::12
GigabitEthernet0/0/0     [up/up]
    FE80::12
    2010:ACAD:250:CC::12
Loopback12               [up/up]

### Task 2 - Routing Configuration

#### CORE:
- [ ] Configure a **default route using an LLA next hop**.
- [ ] A **ping** from CORE to EDGE's GUA should be successful.

LLAs are **guaranteed to be present** and don‚Äôt change, even if GUAs are renumbered. That makes them ideal for **stable local links**, especially for static routing on simple point-to-point connections. 

When configuring routes using LLAs, the exit interface *must* be configured, since LLAs are **only unique on each link**; IOS needs to know **which interface** to send the packet out. Without it, the router wouldn't know which neighbour the LLA refers to.

#### ‚öôÔ∏è Cisco default route using LLA as the next hop
``` bash
ipv6 route ::/0 gigabitethernet0/0/2 fe80::11
```

This command means:

> *Send all unknown traffic to the next-hop at `fe80::11`, but only reachable via interface `G0/0/2`.*

#### EDGE:
- [ ] Configure **internal static routes** using the LLAs as next hops.  *Reflect: How many routes do you need?*
- [ ] Configure a **default route** to Remote networks using the GUA next hop.
- [ ] Pings to the TFTP/SCP servers should be successful.

Configure **specific static routes** for known internal networks, CORE‚Äôs LAN and loopback interfaces, and then use a **single default route** to handle all traffic destined for the external or teacher network. This approach keeps the routing table clean and easy to troubleshoot. Instead of overloading EDGE with unnecessary routes, you define only what‚Äôs needed for internal reachability, and let the default route handle everything else.

> *Don‚Äôt over-configure. Use specific routes for known subnets and a default for ‚Äòeverything else.‚Äô Less clutter = cleaner troubleshooting.*

#### üîç C02 ‚Äî Verification & Collection of Information
üìù In your `w02-ipv6-<username>.txt` file, create a section labelled:

```diff
=== CO2 ‚Äì IPv6 Routing ===
```

Copy the following commands:
```bash
#--- From EDGE and CORE
show ipv6 route static | begin Application
#--- CORE
ping 2001:db8:192::69                 ! TFTP Server
#--- EDGE

### Task 3 -  üñ•Ô∏è Host & VM Configuration

### 1. Windows PC:
- [ ] Use SLAAC to obtain an IPv6 address.
- [ ] Verify at least 1 GUA and 1 LLA in the `2010:acad:U:aa::/64` network
- [ ] A ping to the TFTP server IPv6 address should be successful
- [ ] Test web browser access: `http://[2001:db8:192::69]`

> In IPv6, you must **enclose the IP address in square brackets** when using it in a URL, which tells protocols like HTTP that it's an address, not part of the port or path.
### 2. Alpine VM:

#### üñ•Ô∏è Why You‚Äôre Using Alpine Linux in This Lab

In this lab, you'll work with a lightweight Linux VM called **[Alpine](https://www.alpinelinux.org/downloads/)** instead of another Windows system. In the real world, most network devices, servers, and cloud systems run on Linux, and often without a graphical interface. By using Alpine, you‚Äôll gain experience with essential **command-line tools** like `ip`, `ip -6 route`, and `ip neighbor`, which help you understand and verify IPv6 behaviour such as **SLAAC**, **EUI-64**, and routing. 

This is a valuable chance to build comfort with cross-platform networking, preparing you for careers in **DevOps, network engineering, and systems administration**, where Linux is everywhere.

Use `root/cisco` to log in to Alpine.

- [ ] Use `ip link set up dev eth0`
- [ ] Verify SLAAC-derived IPv6 address matches EUI-64 from MAC
- [ ] Use `ip address show`, `ip -6 route show`, and `ip neighbor`

#### ‚öôÔ∏è Alpine Linux - Dynamic IP address

``` bash
ip link set up dev eth0
```

#### üîç Verify your results

```bash
VM-Alpine:~$ ip address show eth0
2: eth0: <BROADCAST,MULTICAST,UP,LOWER_UP> mtu 1500 qdisc pfifo_fast state UP qlen 1000
    link/ether 52:54:00:13:12:93 brd ff:ff:ff:ff:ff:ff
    inet6 2010:acad:250:cc:5054:ff:fe13:1293/64 scope global dynamic flags 100 
       valid_lft 2591921sec preferred_lft 604721sec
    inet6 fe80::5054:ff:fe13:1293/64 scope link 
       valid_lft forever preferred_lft forever
       
VM-Alpine:~$ ip -6 route show
2010:acad:250:cc::/64 dev eth0  metric 256  expires 0sec
fe80::/64 dev eth0  metric 256 
default via fe80::12 dev eth0  metric 1024  expires 0sec
multicast ff00::/8 dev eth0  metric 256 

VM-Alpine:~$ ip neighbor
fe80::12 dev eth0 lladdr 52:54:00:19:89:e5 router ref 1 used 0/0/0 probes 1 REACHABLE
```

Where:
- `link/ether` shows your MAC address.
-  `inet6`shows your IPv6 address.
	- First, your GUA, then your LLA
> **Note:** The interface ID is derived from the 48-bit MAC by inserting `ff:fe` in the middle and flipping the 7th bit (EUI-64).

#### üîç C03 ‚Äî Verification & Collection of Information
üìù In your `w02-ipv6-<username>.txt` file, create a section labelled:

```diff
=== CO3 ‚Äì PC/VM IPv6 Verification ===
```


```bash
# From the PC, copy the output of the command:
ipconfig
curl "http://[2001:db8:192::69]"
```

##### **Verify (run these first) in Alpine Linux**

```bash
# MV - ALPINE:
#-- Review the following commands - We will be using them from now on.

ip address show dev eth0
ip -6 route show
ip neighbor
ping -c 4 PC-Address                ! You will need to find this Address on PC 
ping -c 4 fd00:U:cc::12             ! CORE-Lo12
ping -c 4 2001:db8:192::69
```

##### **How to capture your output in Alpine**


```bash
# ===== Fill these with your U value and your username =====
USER="<username>"
PC="2010:acad:U:aa:"        # PC GUA (replace U) -- find this address
CORE_LO="FD00:U:CC::12"     # CORE loopback LLA (replace U)
TFTP="2001:DB8:192::69"     # TFTP address
FILE="w02-alpine-${USER}.txt"

#-- For this lab we'll run one command at a time 
#-- and save the outputs in the file $FILE;
#-- Later on, we'll move to scripting

##### **How to upload (SCP over IPv6)**

```bash
# IPv6 addresses in scp must be in [brackets] 
# change 'username'

# Verify you created your file with the required information.
ls -l w02-alpline-<username>.txt
more w02-alpline-<username>.txt

# Copy the file to the TFTP server
scp w02-alpine-<username>.txt cisco@[2001:DB8:192::69]:~/submissions/

Use credentials `cisco/cisco`
If you see a host-key prompt the first time, answer **yes**.

> **Common pitfalls**
> ‚ùå Forgot the brackets around the IPv6 address ‚Üí `scp: ambiguous target`
> ‚ùå No route/LL next-hop on Alpine ‚Üí check `ip -6 route show` and confirm default via `fe80::12 dev eth0`

##### **Optional: quick self-check**
- `ip -6 addr show dev eth0` shows **one fe80::** and **one GUA**.
- `ip -6 route show` has a **default** via **fe80::12 dev eth0**
- `ip -6 neigh` lists the CORE link-local.
- All 3 pings return `0% packet loss`.

### Task 4 -  SSH Configuration in Both Routers

- [ ] Create a local **admin** user with **privilege level 15** and **secret password `cisco`** (hashed).
- [ ] Set the device **domain name** to **`cnap.cst`** (needed for key generation).
- [ ] Generate an **RSA host key** with **modulus 1024 bits**.
- [ ] Enforce **SSH version 2 only**.
- [ ] SSH hardening: **authentication retries = 3** and **authentication timeout = 60 seconds**.
- [ ] VTY lines **0‚Äì4**: **login local**, **SSH-only** (no Telnet), and **exec-timeout = 10 minutes**.
- [ ] Set an **enable secret** for privileged mode if you haven't done it yet.

> üü® **Write this in your lab book (must-remember):**  
> _When the next-hop is a **link-local** IPv6 address, always configure the static route with **exit interface + LLA**
> . LLA alone is ambiguous; IOS won‚Äôt install/forward correctly without the interface._

**Heads-up for the physical lab:** 
On real gear, **interface-only** static routes (`ipv6 route ::/0 g0/0/2`) are unreliable on Ethernet; always use **`<interface> <fe80::‚Ä¶>`** for LLA next-hops.
