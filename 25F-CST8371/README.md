# 📘 25F-CST8371 – Enterprise Networking Labs

Welcome to the lab repository for **CST8371: Introduction to Enterprise Networking**  
This course focuses on scalable network design, IPv6, NAT, routing protocols, ACLs, and network management using Cisco equipment and simulation tools.

---
### What you’ll learn (course objectives)
- Implement dynamic routing protocols to optimize network design.
- Implement Access Control Lists (ACLs) to filter traffic.
- Implement Network Address Translation (NAT) services to scale IPv4 addressing schemes.
- Explain, configure, and troubleshoot IPv6 addressing.
- Monitor and troubleshoot networks using network management protocols and tools.

### How to use this repo
1. **Start with the Lab** in `labs/` for the week you’re working on.
2. **Practice reading configs** by doing the Audit in `challenges/`.
3. **Try the Challenge** to apply and demonstrate a working solution.
4. **Reflect** using the prompt in `reflections/` to lock in one improvement for next week.

> **Tip**: Keep your own notes and commands beside each activity so you can reuse good patterns later.

### Activity Types (at a glance)
- **Lab** — Guided, hands-on configuration to build command fluency and reliable habits.
- **Audit** — Read a provided running-config, find baseline gaps → propose the minimal fix → provide one verify command.
- **Challenge** — Time-boxed scenario (design and/or live troubleshooting) to apply concepts under realistic constraints.
- **Reflections** — Evidence-backed debrief: codify your mental model, add two Always-True rules, and record Claim→Evidence→Reasoning with operational proof lines.
