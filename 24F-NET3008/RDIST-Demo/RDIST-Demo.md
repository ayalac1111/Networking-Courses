# Redistribution Challenge Lab - Demo

## Overview

This demo provides an in-depth walkthrough of the lab topology, focusing on route redistribution between EIGRP and OSPF, the issues that arise, and solutions using two methods. Following this demo, youâ€™ll apply these concepts in a challenge lab.

## Topology Overview

### Network Layout

![Topology Diagram](RDIST-Demo.png)

- **R1, R2, and R3** are connected with both **EIGRP and OSPF** configurations.
- **EIGRP** is configured on specific networks and **OSPF** on others to demonstrate the need for redistribution.
- **Loopback Interfaces**: are used to represent networks needing redistribution to simulate real-world network environments.
- **Lo2**:  Does not participate in **EIGRP** or **OSPF**.
- **R1, R2, and R3** should be connected to a management network via their Gi0 interfaces (no shown in the above topology)

### Objectives

1. Configure routers and switches as per topology.
2. Implement EIGRP and OSPF.
3. Redistribute routes between EIGRP and OSPF.
4. Implement a solution to a suboptimal routing path and routing loops.

## Redistribution Process

### Steps in Redistribution

1. **EIGRP Configuration on R2**
	   - Configure **EIGRP Autonomous System 123**.
	   - Advertise **networks 10.1.2.0 and 10.2.3.0** only.
	   - Redistribute the **R2 Loopback** into EIGRP (without the network command).

2. **OSPF Configuration on R1 & R3**
	   - Configure **OSPF Process ID 13** on R1 and R3.
	   - Advertise the **10.1.3.0** network on both routers and **R3 Loopback**.

3. **Redistribute OSPF into EIGRP (on R1)** 
	   - Use the `redistribute` command to bring OSPF routes into EIGRP. 
	   - **Command**: 
		``` bash
		router eigrp 123 
		redistribute ospf 13 metric 10000 100 255 1 1500 
		```
	- **Explanation**: 
		- **ospf 13**: Specifies that OSPF process ID `13` routes are being redistributed into EIGRP. 
		- **metric 10000 100 255 1 1500**: Sets the EIGRP metric for redistributed OSPF routes. 
			- `10000`: Bandwidth in Kbps. 
			- `100`: Delay in tens of microseconds. 
			- `255`: Reliability (value from 0 to 255, where 255 is most reliable). 
			- `1`: Load (value from 0 to 255, where 1 is the lightest load). 				- `1500`: MTU in bytes. 
		- Setting an appropriate metric ensures EIGRP can correctly redistribute these routes.

4. **Redistribute EIGRP into OSPF (on R1)**
	- Redistribute EIGRP routes into OSPF using R1 as the redistribution point. 
		  - **Command**:

		  ```bash 
		  router ospf 13 redistribute eigrp 123 subnets metric 20 
		  ``` 
		  - **Explanation**: 
			  - **eigrp 123**: Specifies that routes from EIGRP AS `123` are being redistributed into OSPF.
			  - **subnets**: Ensures that all subnets, not just classful networks, are redistributed. 
			  - **metric 20**: Sets the OSPF cost for redistributed EIGRP routes. A lower metric value typically makes the route more favourable.

## Problem: Suboptimal Routing

![Topology Diagram](RDIST-Demo-Problem.png)

- **Symptom**: Some routes prefer paths that are not the optimal path, leading to inefficient routing.
- **Cause**: Due to the default Administrative Distance (AD) values, routes may prefer EIGRP over OSPF, or vice versa, based on configured ADs rather than the best path.

---

## Goal
Prioritize **external EIGRP routes** over OSPF routes on a router like R1 or R3.
## Solution: Adjust Administrative Distance

The **Administrative Distance (AD)** for **external OSPF routes** should be higher than that of external EIGRP. This will ensure that routes learned from EIGRP are preferred over OSPF routes.

**Lower the AD of OSPF on R3:
- Adjust OSPF's AD to prioritize OSPF routes over EIGRP where necessary.
- Commands to modify AD:
     ```bash
     router ospf 13
     distance ospf external 180
     ```

**Explanation**
- `distance ospf external 180`: This command increases the AD for **external OSPF routes** to 180, making them less preferred than EIGRP external routes, which have an AD of 170 by default.

**Effect on Routing**
With this configuration:
- **External EIGRP routes (AD = 170)** will be preferred over **external OSPF routes (AD = 180)**.
- **Internal OSPF routes (AD = 110)** and **internal EIGRP routes (AD = 90)** remain unaffected.
- You may need to flush the routing table: `clear ip route *` to see the changes.

## Introducing R3 in Redistribution

## Solution: Using a Route Map with Route Tagging

To effectively prevent routing loops during redistribution in this topology, you would typically need **two separate route maps** configured on both **R1** and **R3**:

1. **Route Map for Tagging EIGRP Routes (TAG_EIGRP_ROUTES)**
	- This route map is applied on **R1 and R3** when redistributing from **EIGRP to OSPF**. It tags specific networks from EIGRP (such as `2.2.2.0/24`, `10.1.2.0/29`, and `10.2.3.0/29`) so that we can later identify them and prevent them from looping back into EIGRP.

	- **Configuration for TAG_EIGRP_ROUTES (on both R1 and R3)**

	``` bash
	access-list 10 permit 2.2.2.0 0.0.0.255 
	access-list 10 permit 10.1.2.0 0.0.0.7 
	access-list 10 permit 10.2.3.0 0.0.0.7  
	
	route-map TAG_EIGRP_ROUTES permit 10  match ip address 10  set tag 100
	```

	- **Explanation**:
	    - The ACL `10` matches the specific networks we want to tag.
	    - The `route-map TAG_EIGRP_ROUTES` uses this ACL to match these networks and applies the **tag `100`** to them when they are redistributed into OSPF.

2. **Applying TAG_EIGRP_ROUTES during Redistribution (on both R1 and R3)**

	``` bash
	router ospf 13  redistribute eigrp 123 subnets route-map TAG_EIGRP_ROUTES
	```

3. **Route Map for Filtering Tagged OSPF Routes (FILTER_OSPF_TO_EIGRP)**
	- This second route map is applied on **R1 and R3** when redistributing from **OSPF back into EIGRP**. 
	- It prevents routes with the tag `100` (indicating they originated in EIGRP) from being redistributed back into EIGRP, thereby stopping potential routing loops.

	- **Configuration for FILTER_OSPF_TO_EIGRP (on both R1 and R3)**
	``` bash
	route-map FILTER_OSPF_TO_EIGRP deny 10  match tag 100
	```
	
	- **Explanation**:
	    - The `route-map FILTER_OSPF_TO_EIGRP` checks for routes tagged with `100`.
	    - By denying routes with tag `100`, we prevent routes originally from EIGRP from being redistributed back into EIGRP, which would create a loop.

4. **Applying FILTER_OSPF_TO_EIGRP during Redistribution (on both R1 and R3)**

``` bash
router eigrp 123  redistribute ospf 13 metric 10000 100 255 1 1500 route-map FILTER_OSPF_TO_EIGRP
```

5. **Summary**
	- **R1 and R3** will both need:
	    - `TAG_EIGRP_ROUTES` route map for tagging specific EIGRP routes when redistributing into OSPF.
	    - `FILTER_OSPF_TO_EIGRP` route map for filtering tagged routes when redistributing from OSPF back into EIGRP.
	- **One route map for tagging routes** when redistributing from **EIGRP to OSPF**.
	- **Another route map for filtering tagged routes** to prevent them from being redistributed back from **OSPF to EIGRP**.
	- **Create a Route Map with Tags on R1 and R3**:
	    - Tag EIGRP routes when redistributing them into OSPF. This tag will allow us to identify and prioritize them within the OSPF routing domain.

---
## Summary

- **Redistribution** allows networks running different routing protocols to communicate but can lead to issues like suboptimal routing and routing loops.
- **Solution 1**: Adjust AD to influence route preference.
- **Solution 2**: Use route maps for more granular control.
